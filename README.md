# Recommendation System

Recommendation System Structure Graph.

The Recommendation System have three components. They can deploy in different computes.
- Batch : Control the training of models and save them into HDFS, and manage the model version and history data. now only it only integrates ALS model.

- Speed: Upload offline model from HDFS, recommend items for users with real-time streaming data from Kafka, and then write the result back to HDFS and Hbase

- Serving: Provide recommendation servive for users. It can extend extra logicals for handling recommended item list. Such as sort, filter, and aggragate algorithm.

- Conclusion
The entire systems use AKKA concurrent frame to support mutli-thread and commication between threads. The part of web use Spary (light-weight Scala web server frame). Data mainly store in Hbase and HDFS.
Now the project is incomplete. Many alogrithm and data processes logical can add to this project in the future. 

Extension:
  - Batch, Speed layer can extend more algorithm, like Descision tree, Clusting, and PCA etc.
  - Serving can access to variance recommended data sets that are generated by different recommendation algorithm and then combine them by a specify merge strategy.
